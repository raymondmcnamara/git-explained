<h2>Version Control</h2>
<p>Version control is a system that helps track changes to files or code over time, allowing multiple people to collaborate on a project efficiently. It records changes, stores different versions of the files, and makes it possible to revert to earlier versions or compare differences between versions.</p>
<h2>Git</h2>
<p>Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase at the same time without interfering with each otherâ€™s work.</p>
