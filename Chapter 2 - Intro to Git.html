<h1>Chapter 2: Intro to Git</h1>
<h2>Version Control</h2>
<p>Version control is a system that helps track changes to files or code over time, allowing multiple people to collaborate on a project efficiently. It records changes, stores different versions of the files, and makes it possible to revert to earlier versions or compare differences between versions.</p>
<h2>Git</h2>
<p>Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase at the same time without interfering with each other’s work.</p>
<h2>Init</h2>
<p>The git init command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. It creates a hidden .git folder that stores all the metadata, configurations, and version history for the project. After running this command, the directory becomes a Git repository, allowing you to start tracking changes, committing files, and using other Git features.</p>
<h2>pwd</h2>
<p>The command pwd in Git is not specific to Git itself—it’s a standard Unix/Linux shell command that stands for “print working directory.” When used in a terminal inside a Git repository, it shows the full path to the current directory you're in. This is useful to confirm where you are in the file system, especially when working with multiple Git repositories or nested folders.</p>
